/**
 * A zipper that represents a position in a JSON document and supports navigation and modification.
 *
 * The `focus` represents the current position of the cursor; it may be updated with `withFocus` or
 * changed using navigation methods like `left` and `right`.
 *
 * circe includes three kinds of cursors. [[Cursor]] is the simplest: it doesn't keep track of its
 * history. [[HCursor]] is a cursor that does keep track of its history, but does not represent the
 * possibility that a navigation or modification operation has failed. [[ACursor]] is the richest
 * cursor, since it both tracks history through an underlying [[HCursor]] and can represent failed
 * operations.
 *
 * [[GenericCursor]] is an abstraction over these three types, and it has several abstract type
 * members that are required in order to represent the different roles of the three cursor types.
 * `Self` is simply the specific type of the cursor, `Focus` is a type constructor that represents
 * the context in which the focus is available, `Result` is the type that is returned by all
 * navigation and modification operations, and `M` is a type class that includes the operations that
 * we need for `withFocusM`.
